  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>


      <h4>Are you a cafe? Can I come by and get a cup of coffee?</h4>

      <h3>Yes! We also serve a number of food options. Our menu changes weekly. Stop by, have a meal, or even just a cup of coffee. If you live in or are visiting our city&#44; you are welcome to come by and pick up a bag (or ten) of coffee. We may even have something brewed up for you to sample!</h3>


      <h4>Why is your coffee more expensive than what I can buy at the grocery store?</h4>
      <h3>Quality.  Corners are cut in both the cultivation and roasting of cheap coffees which allows for those low prices. Two areas we really ought to consider&#44; however&#44; are the environmental sustainability of cutting corners in cultivation and the distinct possibility that the farmers may not be paid a &#39;fair trade&#39; wage.<br></h3> 

      <h4>How long will my coffee be fresh? 
      <h3>For peak freshness&#44; enjoy your coffee within two weeks of the roast date. It&#39;s best to exceed no more than four weeks. Please remember to grind your coffee right before brewing if at all possible.

      <h4>Is it a good idea to store my coffee in the refrigerator or freezer? 
      <h3>No. The problem here lies in the fact that condensation will inevitably build up whenever you remove the coffee from these cold environments to room temperature.  That spells trouble for your coffee.  We suggest buying only the quantity of coffee you will drink over a two or three-week period and storing it in a dark cabinet in your kitchen.<p>
       
      Do you have a question not answered here? Send it along&#44; and we&#39;ll give you an answer. <p>
